# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? We can view the whole history of revisions made to one or more files.

  Why is it useful? It allows us to merge revisions made by different people at different times, without having to copy and paste the new code into the old code or vice versa. Also we are able to roll back to a previous version if someone made a error to the original after a merge.


* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy off of the original file. You'd use one if, you wanted to have another person work on a section of the original without directly affecting the original.


* What is a commit? A commit is a save point after changes have been made. 

What makes a good commit message? A good commit message is specific in regards to what file was changed or what was changed on the file. Also what day, time or version the change was made on.


* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when there are disagreeing changes between the branches. So one branch has changes that are not present in another branch and vice versa.
